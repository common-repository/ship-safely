Protection on shipment, your brand and your reputation, and the opportunity to create an additional profit centre.

== Description ==

**Ship-Safely for WooCommerce - Your one-click shipping protection**

Your business is the heart of our business. We have tailored our insurance offering for your customers to purchase our policy during the ‘checkout’ process (during their buying experience).

Ship-Safely can help protect your reputation by empowering your customer to choose to insure their purchase throughout the shipping process. Our platform also enables you, as the store owner, to receive a percentage of each sale that you collect.

We offer protection of your brand, protection of your reputation, and the opportunity to create an additional profit centre in your business. When it comes time for your customers to claim, we simply re-order from your store, so you achieve another sale in your business.

**How does it work?**

First of all? **It’s free to install.** We do not charge you for installing our app on your store or having a merchant account with us.

When Ship-Safely is up and running in your shop, customers will be able to access buyer protection at the ‘checkout’ that covers items Damaged, Lost or Stolen throughout the shipping process. Our premiums start at a fraction of your customer's purchase, opening shipping insurance to everyone no matter the cost value.

Once a customer accepts and pays you for the insurance policy, we will then charge your nominated credit card the amount of the insurance, less your agreed commission.

It’s completely seamless from integration to purchasing policies and making a claim. We handle the entire claims process for WooCommerce shop owners so that you can focus on doing what you do best – running your business.

**Tehnical support from a real human**

Our Australian-based support team understands you and your customer’s needs so that when you need assistance, you’ll be talking with a team who is equipped to help you in the best way possible. 

Contrary of what most people think, even as a tech team, we do prefer to speak to you in plain English!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does your insurance cover worldwide shipments? =

We provide cover to most countries on this planet. There are always exceptions so feel free to [contact us](mailto:support@ship-safely.com) to check.

= Does the purchaser really need insurance? =

Insurance is a personal choice. We are providing consumers with the option to purchase insurance where none was previously available offering an added level of comfort and security for the off chance that their purchase is Damaged, Lost or Stolen whilst on its way.

= Doesn’t the postal/courier/carrier service cover damage or lost items in transit? =

Most delivery partners are not required to provide any guarantee of delivery and are not legally obliged to provide replacement of such products by law. This is a global trend and insurance can be the answer for your e-commerce store whilst protecting your customers.

= Who is underwriting Ship-Safely? =

Ship-safely.com is a trading name of Nano Insurance Limited, a licensed insurer authorised to provide Online Marine Transit Insurance in designated countries around the world. Our founders have over 70 years of combined insurance experience from both broking and underwriting roles.
